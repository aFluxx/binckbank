# Binck OpenApi Client

This client is a loosely based implementation of [binckbank api](https://github.com/binckbank-api/client-js)
This is mainly a rework of the parts we needed in ES6.

## Usage

The use case for which this project was developed is to find instrument quotes with high % gain, or high % loss. This is mainly focused on finding instruments to do option trades with that have high volatility.

## Installation

Copy over `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.

## Run on windows

Run `binckboncK.bat`, this will instantiate a localhost server.
